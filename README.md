# contractiveCST
numerical results on the contractive unitary for the Classical Shadow Tomography.
## Calculation scripts
[ContractSample.jl](ContractSample.jl) and [CliffordSample.jl](CliffordSample.jl) are used to simulate the classical shadow tomography protocals with different unitary ensembles with the knowledge of the location where Pauli operators are applied.

[ContractSlid.jl](ContractSlid.jl) and [CliffordSlid.jl](CliffordSlid.jl) are used to simulate the classical shadow tomography protocals with different unitary ensembles without the knowledge of the location where Pauli operators are applied.

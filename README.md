# contractiveCST
numerical results on the contractive unitary for the Classical Shadow Tomography.
## Calculation scripts
ContractSample.jl and CliffordSample.jl are used to  
conractSlid.jl and CliffordSlid.jl
[ContractSample.jl](ContractSample.jl) and [CliffordSample.jl](CliffordSample.jl) are used to simulate the classical shadow tomography protocals with different unitary ensembles to
